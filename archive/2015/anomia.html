<p>Many people think they are quick witted and have the ability to think fast. When in the situation of CSH, how fast can you blurt out an answer before your opponent can?</p>
<p>Anomia plays on the fact that our brains are brimming with random information (songs, presidents, animals). It's easy enough to give an example of anything, but you will find out that your brain does not perform as well as you would think under pressure! CSH Anomia tests your ability to think fast and come up with a correct CSH related answer before the person you're playing against shouts against you.</p>
<p>We took a twist on the game Anomia, and all of the categories are related to CSH.</p>
