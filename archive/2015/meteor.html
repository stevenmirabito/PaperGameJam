<p>A large meteor has collided with Mars, showering its surface with valuable minerals. Eager to make claim on the riches of its neighbor, the great powers of a future Earth have sent teams of colonists to establish their hold on the Red Planet. The peaceful terraforming and resource extraction projects quickly break down into deadly skirmishes and all out wars.</p>
<p>Each mother country desires and is willing to pay top dollar for a certain mineral and has a surplus mineral that it is willing to sell for cheap. The unique market position of each country makes certain resource strategies suited for each colonial nation. The four playable countries are New Texas, the Warsaw Federation, the Empire of Cathay, and New Quebec.</p>
<p>As the players progress and build CO2 emitters, the atmosphere of Mars transitions from barren, to Earth-like, to corrosive. Players use resources to create resource extractors or to create soldiers to capture or destroy resource extractors. Skirmishes outside of an Earth-like atmosphere are dangerous.</p>
<p>The game ends once players have either dominated the whole board or the atmosphere has become too corrosive to advance.</p>
