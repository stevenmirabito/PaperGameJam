<p>Heart of the Dungeon is a top-down asymmetric turn-based game where three heroes fight against a Dungeon Lord. 2 or 4 players -- if two, one is the Dungeon Lord while the other controls all three heroes. If four, one Dungeon Lord versus a player for each hero.</p>
<p>Two main aspects. First, the mix of chess movement/attack and tabletop RPG language/mechanics. Secondly, the asymmetry of the Dungeon Lord versus the Heroes. I cannot think (though I don't doubt they exist) of a game that has the same asymmetrical nature.</p>
