<p>Our game is a d6-based deck building card game. Every card has a theme that decides the general category of effect. However, the exact result of every card is decided by rolling a six sided die, giving every play the potential to go horribly, horribly wrong. As the game progresses, you assemble your evil arsenal, deciding the flavor of your deck based on the themes that you choose. The game is designed around a villains battle royal, and as with any crook's dire, diabolical plan, anything can backfire!</p>
<p>We focused on developing a large amount of content in a dynamic fashion such that each card can affect the outcome of a turn in a different way each time it's played. Following this trend, we decided to make every card unique so that every game feels like a new experience.</p>
