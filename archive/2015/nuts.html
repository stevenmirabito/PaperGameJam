<p>Use your ultra American Pachinko skills to knock the Super Deluxe Hexagonal Projectile into one of the four goals. each goal gives between 100 and 400 points, and you get five tries. Heaven (top right) is worth 400 points, Below (lower left) is worth 300, "Good" in the center is worth 100 points, and "Wow" between good and heaven is worth 200.</p>
<p>All of the point values are written on the board.</p>
<p>Our game is a unique game imported from Japan made by an unknown manufacturer. The manual has been lost, so its true purpose has been interpolated. We estimate that it was once used for determining quantities of food to ration out during times of poor harvest.</p>
